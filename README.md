# eecs168 - Introduction to VLSI Design

## Lab Resources

Every communication will be at https://github.com/tkimva/ucr-eecs168. Please use GITHUB page instead of email to ask any question to TA. Labs must be finished on-time. Late labs will not be accepted. A lab report, using the specified lab report format is required for all lab assignments, including tutorials, and is due at the beginning of the following lab period after the lab is due. Individual labs may also require additional information such as schematics, layout, or a summary of results. Please be sure to include this information in your lab report. 5 lab reports are required to turn in and total scores are 100. Group work (limit 2) is allowed but individual each student is required lab report submission and those lab reports should not be the same in the group.

### Attendance Policy

- Students who are late for lab 10 mins or less are considered tardy but present or the lab period. (10% penalty of your following lab report)
- Students who are more than 10 mins late for lab are considered absent. (50% penalty of your following lab report)
- Any missed lab should be made up within 1 week with 50% penalty, otherwise no credit. Missing a lab is acceptable only when emergency occurs (eg. Medical emergency, doctor letter is required)

### Cheating Policy

Each lab report should be individual even if you can work together. If I find students cheating on the lab report, I give no credit for lab given report. Then I forward your case to the academic integrity board at UCR.
